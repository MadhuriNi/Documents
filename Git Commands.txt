1. pushing code for the first time in GIT : 

local --> stage --> commit --> github

Git Commands :

cd /c/My_Git_Local/Practise

git config --global http.proxy http://ecs-devel:sabres@east.network.fedex.com:3128

git init  (to create empty git folder/new local repository)
git config user.email madhuri.nirmale@gmail.com  (to set user email)
git add *  (Add files from local to staging)
git status  (List the files which needs to commit)
git commit -m "first commit" (it moves the files from stage to commit)
git remote add origin https://github.com/MadhuriNi/Practise.git  (it tells where we have to push the code)
git push -u origin master


2. pulling code from the git for the first time :

create a folder to download the pulled code "My_Git_Download"

git clone http://........ (get the code from git)

then import this code in your workspace


3. updating the code and comiting or pushing into the git again :

go to the folder where there is our code

git add *
git status
git commit -m "this is commit from me"
git remote add origin .....
git push -u origin master



4. how to pull code from github

goto ur folder

git pull origin master



5.  creating the branch and updating it and then merging it

git checkout -b develop (this creates the new branch and is independent of original code)
git branch (it shows the number of branches)
git add *
git commit -m "am working on the develop branch"
git push origin develop



pulling the branch :

git pull origin develop
git checkout develop (it switches to the already created branch)


merging the develop branch with master :

git checkout master (goto master branch)
git merge develop   (develop branch will be merged into the master(active branch))



6. to push new changes to existing repository present in git

First goto the path from where ur project was pushed to git
 
 C:\My_Git_Local\Practise
 
 go to eclipse and import this project in the eclipse
 
 GIT_Workspace\Practise
 
 
 so whatever changes done here
 
 do 
 
 Show in Local Terminal --> Git Bash
 
 git add .
 git status
 git commit -m "adding new package"
 git push
